============

You are given a Secret which encapsulates a function that accepts a single integer parameter and returns an integer. In Java or a language of your choice, write an application that determines if Secret is an additive function secret(x+y) = secret(x) + secret(y) for all prime numbers less than N where N is a given integer.  Assume you are going to ship this code. Use your judgement to determine what you need to include. Document any assumptions or choices you make in your implementation. Also, include an explanation of your choice of language.
